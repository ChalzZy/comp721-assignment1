                  It was a challenge trying to get the database connection
                  working with PHP. Whenever there was an error message, the
                  whole application would just crash.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Debugging was a significant challenge. Unlike java, php isn't
                  very specific with the error messages it displays. When
                  debugging I deployed the 'trial and error' approach. I
                  commented out code that I suspected to cause problems, and
                  continued until I found the culprit.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The pathing of links can sometimes be a challenge. The php
                  language uses a relative pathing system compared to an
                  absolute pathing system.
                </li>
                <li>
                  The 'poststatusprocess.php' file was the hardest to make. But
                  once I created that file, the rest of the assignment was
                  easier. I believe I found it challenge because I was just
                  starting to put into practice what I had learnt from the lab
                  tasks.

                  Checking if the database result was empty or had content.

                  Rendering content in the correct order. For example: If a
                  button failed to render, the footer may not display.

                  I would like to learn how to make reusable PHP code. For
                  example: Currently my footer and header are manually
                  copy/pasted onto every document. It would be interesting to
                  see if there is a dynamic way to do this. Similar to React or
                  EJS.

                  I used a lot of Stack Overflow, YouTube, lecture slides, W3
                  Schools, past labs, PHP documentation and Bootstrap
                  documentation.

                  One lab that helped a lot was the week 5 lab 4. I studied that
                  lab initially to figure out how to connect to MySQL. Though
                  much of came after was learnt from the above resources.
